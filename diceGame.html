		<p>
			This is going to be a form of Blackjack played with a four, six, eight, ten, twelve, and twenty sided die. The way its playeyed is after stting up player one and player two you will start out with a hand of zero and can either choose hit or stand. Choosing hit will give you a roll with a random die and that will be your starting hand which you can continue adding to with hit or choose stand and that is your final hand. If your hand exceeds 31 you will have a bust and you automatically lose.
